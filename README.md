## About the Project
This project was created by a team of developers to explore and apply Agile and SCRUM methodologies in practice.

🎯 The focus was not on building a polished product, but on establishing effective collaboration between developers, the Scrum Master, and a hypothetical Product Owner.

## Workflow Highlights
- Weekly stand-up meetings and sprint reviews were conducted to assess progress.
- Sprint retrospectives were held at the end of each sprint to reflect and improve.
- The team adopted the strategy:
  "Learn first, build later."
- The first sprint was fully dedicated to learning new technologies, setting a foundation for further developments.
